oncepts of JUSTICE

The method of a political theorist
    1. A set of judgments about the nature of reality, the good, and of ways of knowing
    2. A conceptual framework

Wage-earners art: to affect the lesser

Assumptions: the "missing link" that connects the premise and the conclusion
    - Often not directly stated

In general: If you find an argument convincing, it means you accept the assumptions underlying it
    - Attacking arguments oftentimes involves questioning assumptions

Plato: The Republic
 Book II + III Lecture: 

Platonic "Forms"
 - It doesn't matter what other people think, it's just wrong (or right), unjust or just, stupid or not stupid, etc. There is a pure, ideal form of it. We can know this through reationality.
 
 If there's as value to right or wrong, like if one person thinks something's right, and something else is wrong, how do you know which is true?

 Truth and Imitation: 
 Imitation is a corruption, a lesser of the higher order
 There should be no 'double men' - if you try to be good at multiple things, you will screw it up.
 According to nature, you are born to do one thing and specialize in society.
 If you are born with a brutish nature=> you should be a soldier; good at woodworking => be a carpenter, etc.
 

"Just City" characteristics: 
    - Guardians
    - Education system: censorship (not exposing kids to injustices and evils)
    - There shouldn't be any 'dual people', or 'double men' - if you try to be good at multiple things, you will screw it up.
    
    # How do we find justice?


Platonic Idea of structural functionalism:

- Sees society as a complex "macro" organism
- Each part contributes to the overall function of the system
- Plato says you are part of a machine, put your head down and do your part and the city as an entity would be happy. If you are doing what you are supposed to be doing, happiness will follow.
- MOderation in wealth and poverty
- No laws
- Gold, Silver, Bronze classes of people born: Rulers, Guardians, Workers
Today has a more modern thinking that everyone should be happy -> plato is just you are part of a machine

JUSTICE 

The Four Virtues

1. Wisdom
    - Found in the guardians, the philosophers (lovers) of reason and logic, who rule the town
2. Courage
    - Found in the auxillaries, the warrior class, educated to know the enemy (cloth being pure white, when dyed it will never be white again) and be fierce and ready to die for the protection of the city
3. Temperance
    - Moderation, (see: Temperance movement in the US to get rid of alcohol), not giving in too much to your appetites
    - The bronze people, the laboring workers
4. Justice
    - Justice resides in people following their roles
    - Justice is nothing more, nothing less than doing what you're supposed to be doing
    - Justice is not being a busybody (hindrance)
    - Don't do anything you aren't supposed to do - dont be a ruler if you were born to be a guardian

What makes an individual just?


-- Simpsons episode about IQ and rulers; everyone thought their ideas were better than each others, so the utopia never happens --

Plato and Democracy
the idea of democracy - Plato wouldn't be a democrat, even in the context of athenian democracy

The Athenian system
    Citizens: Athenian males over 20 years old
        - only about 10-20%
    Assembly composed of citizens 
        - met for 40 sessions, quorum was 6000
    Council of 500 
        - chosen randomly, by lottery, "steering committee", everyone had a chance to 'rule'
        - steering communities

BOOK VI Metaphor of the ship - democracy and its defects

If you are on a ship, you gotta get home, supplies are running low. Who are you going to put your faith in to steer the ship?

Sailors - people who focus on vice instead of virtue, rowdy, etc.
Navigator - spent his whole life to navigate yo shit

You are gonna want the navigator to navigate yo shit. Not the sailors. That's Plato's view on democracy. 

Aristotle critiques Plato: Logical relationships are not the same as empirical relationships
Just because its logical in your head and from what you observe, doesn't mean that's real. 

Aristotle filters platos ideas with empiricism.

Aristotle critiques Plato's city as its "unity", like one person.

Aristotle says a city is "plurality", as in they are separate parts that can still be working towards one goal.

"Telos"
Telogical view of things - all things are in the process of becoming, a naturalistic view
"to understand natures, you have to watch it unfold", to identify its "Final Cause". 
All things have material cause  


Forms -> Concept -> Entities ->
                             -> Imitations
                             ->


Forming cities/societies (political association) is the "end" or final cause of people.
Man is by nature a poltical animal.

Nature: There is a 'ruling' nature, and a 'slave' nature
people are born as rulers and slaves, and in a perfect world where they accept the role they complement and fulfill each other's final causes and are beneficial

  Plato's noumenalism vs Aristotle's naturalism

  St. Augustine (354-430 AD)
    the earthly city
    "anti" - whatever is happening is God's will
    "all men, so long as they are mortal, must of necessity be miserable"
    Suffering was justified as part of God's plan
