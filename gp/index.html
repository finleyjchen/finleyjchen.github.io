            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This guide is a work in progress. There are tons of typos, stuff to fix up, etc. Everything is subject to change. Most questions can be answered through the search bar in the Gangplank Mains subreddit, and also check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gangplankmains/comments/51osgg/complete_faq_for_aspiring_gangplank_mains/">FAQ</a>. It was started as a small web development project (to try out different techniques in CSS), but I thought, why not make a good guide, updated per patch, with everything there is to know about gangplank? I present to you, the most in-depth written guide anybody has every made on Gangplank. I am currently hosting the website off my github.io site, I may pay for hosting should enough people be interested in this guide. You can see the entire creation and new updates here: <a href="https://github.com/inlorfaze/inlorfaze.github.io">Github Source</a></p>

            <p>My name is inlorfaze. I have been playing gangplank since 2015 and have a cumulative 1 million mastery points on gangplank. I started playing him at gold 2 and got to masters with him. <img id="masterimg" src="img/master.PNG"></p>
            <p>I play a unique, very offensive playstyle because I am very confident in my mechanics. This guide is not what I think is best, however. It will include several different playstyles and in-depth top lane discussion. I have played every type of gangplank you can think of - full ad runes, adc gangplank, jungle gangplank, ap gangplank, you name it. I've played it. In high elo NA. Which is why I think that this guide is actually worth reading. This guide is not law - you need to read through this guide, and play the many different variations. Gangplank is a champion that takes many games to learn - he is extremely rewarding, but expect to have a huge learning curve. Remember - practice makes perfect. Reading this guide isn't going to get you do diamond - reading this guide and finding your niche by playing a lot of gangplank will, however. </p>
            <h3>Follow this guide and you WILL gain elo</h3>
            <p>Order of priority to learn to win the game:
            <ol>
                <li>Macro play: Learn rotations and positioning, never get caught</li>
                <li>Micro play: Stay healthy in lane, ward up strategically, and outtrade or solo kill</li>
                <li>Itemization: Build according to your playstyle and your enemies/matchup</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>The most common question: Mid or Top?</h1>
            <p>Probably one of the most frequently asked questions, the answer is it really is up to you. For mid lane, you enjoy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Shorter lane - harder to overextend</li>
                    <li>Your jungler is closester - you won't feel like an island if you have a support and jungler roaming near you.</li>
                    <li>Easier to manage matchups - You can play very safe without getting froze on, guaranteeing farm and relevance in the game</li>
                    <li>Team Comp - you generally run glass cannon in this build, so your team can still have a tank top lane and round out your team composition much better</li>
                    <li>Have more control of the map - roaming is much easier in the mid lane</li>
                </ul>
                In the top lane, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use brush to use barrels</li>
                    <li>Bring aoe AD damage to your team, allow mid laner to bring AP to the team</li>
                    <li>Build bruiser and 1v1/1v2</li>
                    <li>Round out a team comp - maybe you have a tank support and utility mid, so your team needs more damage and aoe</li>
                    <li>Easier matchups - depending on the popular champions of the patch, top lane is usually better for Gangplank when it comes to matchups.</li>
                </ul>
                I personally prefer the mid lane because top lane can have some nasty matchups that render you useless for the majority of the game, but that is because in high elo people will know to camp you very hard in the top lane, as gangplank is weak to tower dives. Tough mid lane matchups can be easier to work around if you understand wave management. For help on that, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/dEX7JxeKCxg">Dong Huap's video</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/HSQWcHIl5oc">SoloRenektonOnly's video</a>.

            <p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>
        </section>
        <section id="runes">
            <h1>Runes</h1>
                <p>Right now the best runes are Kleptomancy, Summon Aery, and Grasp of the Undying.</p>
                <p><b>Kleptomancy</b></p>
                    <p>Kleptomancy is best when you are vs tanks like Shen, Maokai, etc. Champions that you can harass while still farming with autoattacks, becasue you are going to be trying to use your q for solely harass and getting items with kleptomancy. Klepto is really efficient against passive lanes because they can't do much to stop your scaling, and you can get triforce really, really fast (like pre 10 minutes fast). Just watch out because it is not very effective when you are behind, because the enemy laner can most likely zone you, making you use q's and barrels to farm and not getting use out of klepto.</p>
                <p><b>Summon Aery</b></p>
                    <p>Summon Aery was best before its base damages were nerfed. It is most effective in mid lane, as it is the best offensive GP rune that will also give you the AD bonus adaptive damage, giving you around 80AD at level 1. Against squishy laners, you will notice your absurd poke damage. Aery also works with barrels, so you can farm with q's and harass with barrels and still get the bonus damage off. Take it over grasp vs squishy laners who don't have too much lane pressure either, such as Taliyah, Ahri, Kassadin, Fizz, etc.</p>
                <p><b>Grasp of the Undying</b></p>
                    <p>Grasp of the Undying is best in the top lane, vs hard laners that generally counter GP. This list includes Riven, Darius, Renekton, Irelia, etc. CHampions who are very strong lane bullies with gap closers. Going the Grasp tree will give you +130 health instead of 16 adaptive AD, making it a very strong defensive rune. YOu will notice you can win trades with it, because your Q procs grasp with the same damage and healing as melee champions. You will generally gain more maximum health and lane healing from it than most champions who use grasp because you can use it from range. You can auto attack your barrels right after you place it as well to keep it from running out of time if the enemy laner is tryign to wait out your in combat time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="builds">
            <h1>Builds</h1>
            <p>Builds vary by situation. I'll be honest - in high elo, you just don't seem to be strong enough to carry games unless you run full damage. You need to scout out your team, figure out who will be doing the most damage to you, who's the most skilled player on your team and on theirs, and build accordingly.</p>

            <p><b>Summoner Spells</b> TP vs Exh vs ign WIP</p>
            <p><b>TP is generally used the most. It is always very useful and most important for top lane gangplank. In the midlane, it will help a ton with your farming and back timings, especially against hard matchups.</b></p>
            <p><b>Starting Items</b></p>
            <p>Starting Items vary. They are very situational, and depend highly on the matchup (as well as the jungler). To figure out which starting item to use, see the <a href="matchups.html">matchup guide</a>
            <p><b>Skill Upgrades: </b>Always max Q -> E -> W, with ult every time.</p>

            <p>What about levels 1-4?: Don't level up anything level 1 if they have a morgana, lux, etc. and can kill you level 1. In this case you'd need to level up w first to escape that. Otherwise, always start Q. Now, there are three early lane starting skills. Some run Lvl 3 Q > W > Q, for easy harass. This is only good if you need to worry about an early level 2 or 3 gank from a jungler, like a Lee Sin, Elise, Rek'sai. Not only to cleanse cc, but to gain health. <i>Tip!: IF they have a Zac, Rakan, etc. knocking you up and you need to escape, you can't cleanse knockups, however you CAN cleanse and flash, thus negating the knockup.</i> Running Q > E > W is the most standard, because most likely you will just be sitting back, farming with Q and not have to worry too much about ganks. At level 2, get barrel and instantly place one down just behind your minion wave, or directly in it. Running Q > E > Q is also viable. It is useful if you are against an easy matchup, such as Kassadin or Nasus. Having level 2 Q damage will increase your barrel damage even more, helping you shove a lane with barrels, or going for an early kill.</p>

           <p>Always build <img id="itemImage" src="Trinity_Force_item.png" alt="Trinity_Force_item"> first. IF you started mana crystal first and you have enough to buy sheen on your first back, buy it over anything. If you backed with a corrupting potion and not enough to buy sheen, it is better to skip the mana crystal because the mana you get from leveling up is enough to still let you spam q's in lane, making it more efficient to opt for a long sword, dagger, or ruby crystal to give you better laning stats.</p>
           <p>When to buy Cull?</p>
           <p>Cull is best of a buy if you buy it on the first back and can't afford sheen. It is best when you are vs a tank or a passive laner and you can get really good farm (aim for completing the cull stacks in 11 minutes after you buy it), which means that if you buy the cull at 7 minutes, by 20 minutes you would have made 180 gold. It is better to buy long sword or something else instead if you are snowballing because it will let you get triforce faster.</p>

            </section>
            <section id="barrels">
                <h1>Barrels</h1>
                <p>Note: All of these combos are useful. A good gangplank will use the right one at the right time, making gangplank one of the most advanced champions to play. I will discuss how to know when to use the right combo in the <a href="#mechanics">mechanics</a> section. Barrel cooldown decreases at level 7 and level 13.</p>
                <p><b>Single Barrel: </b>Most useful at level 13, you can place these right on top of people, and if you practice the timing, most likely will hit people. Useful for chasing, and against tanks who have slower attack speed. Most efficient, since it only takes one barrel. Pre level 13 you will probably want to auto the barrel once to prime it.</p>
                <p><b>Double Barrel: </b>Bread and butter combo. Most useful combo, use it when chasing, kiting, etc. See: <a href="#doublebarrel">double barrel with flash</a>
                <p><b>Triple Barrel: </b>The Tobias Fate favorite, sexy AND useful! Place a barrel, place another barrel, Q first one and place the third barrel connecting to the second one you placed, in any direction you want. Hard to explain in words. You can also place a third barrel with your auto, however you will not be doing that much (and it's not that useful).</p>
                <p><b>One Part: </b>A bit harder of a combo to land, the key is to place a barrel, press Q on the barrel outside of Q range, and as Gangplank walks up to Q it, place another barrel as soon as you see him do his Q animation. The time it takes for his Q to travel will be just enough time to get his second barrel off.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="mechanics">
                <h1>Mechanics</h1>
                <p>Knowing when to use barrels to maximize damage is very important. Gangplank can only hold 3 barrels at a time, so keeping the cooldown of your next barrel is very important.</p>
                <p><b>Enemies destroying your barrels: </b>ADC's (I'm looking at you Caitlyn!) love to try to auto attack your barrels. As you reach higher elo, you will notice nearly everyone realizes if they auto your barrel, you will lose most of your damage and render you useless. Be not afraid, high elo mains have figured it out! If a melee champion is trying to auto your barrels, you are in a good position. Outplay and they will lose an autoattack AND you will get a barrel off and a passive reset. Pre level 13, your barrels tick down slower. Use this to your advantage by placing it -> Enemy walks up to auto the barrel -> and you walk up and auto the barrel, then Q just when the barrel's first tick goes. This method works nearly every time, however you might lose out on sheen damage. This works best early game pre-sheen. </p>
                <p>Against ranged enemies, it can be just as easy to land a barrel. Instead of q'ing the barrel, you place another and auto it just as it ticks down. With good timing, you should be able to always get the auto off faster than the adc's auto, since you are melee and closest the barrel.</p>
                <p class="imgcaption">Ashe trying to auto my barrel feat. Gosu. Show'em who's boss!</p>
                <img src="https://gyazo.com/57c3f440359692988db467260cd1dde3.gif" width="600">
                <p><b>Saving barrels: </b>Using the triple barrel combo is fun and flashy. However, it may not be the best combo to use in a teamfight. Using three barrels means you won't have any left. One trick you can use is to place a barrel in a place that the enemy can't see or probably won't go to auto, then wait for the barrel cooldown. In this case, you will have 1 barrel down, and 3 barrels left, allowing you to do more with an extra barrel. If you only use a triple barrel combo in a fight, landing one barrel may not be enough, so use double and single barrels, like in this example.</p>
                <img src="https://i.gyazo.com/aa1eb60fa1fe6cc695a48deb539c3e64.gif" alt="https://gyazo.com/aa1eb60fa1fe6cc695a48deb539c3e64" width="800"/>
                <p><b>Using Flash:</b> You can use flash to make some <i>flashy</i> plays. These are difficult (and risky if you mess up and just flash in place), however I think the most reliable and best one is the flash auto barrel.</p>
                <img src="https://gyazo.com/004bc8fad33fa3c4f8dddb99afa68b74.gif" width="600">

                <p><b>Chokeholds and teamfight spots:</b> WIP</p>
                <p><b>Passive resets</b> Using your passive is the key to winning 1v1's, taking down turrets, and shredding tanks. This only works when you have at least .74 Attack Speed, so you'll need to be at least level 6 or have a dagger in your inventory. </p>

                <p><b>Special Interactions:</b> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Your Q counts as an auto attack - it will proc Braum passives, proc grasp, aery, etc.</li>
                    <li>Your passive stacks - reset it as much as you want, without worrying about waiting 2 seconds before applying it again. This means you can chain two barrels, and apply your passive 3 times in a row. That's a lot of true damage!</li>
                    <li>W-Flash - you can flash when you W after being knocked up - thus cleansing the knockup (you can't otherwise cleanse knockups)</li>
                    <li>Using barrels to speed up is efficient to chase (not recommended pre-phage), get back to lane, or run away - the best way is to keep one outside of your base while healing, and hit it/auto attack it for the speed boost. </li>
