        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am inlorfaze. I have been playing gangplank since 2015 and have a cumulative 1 million mastery points on gangplank. I started playing him at gold 2 and got to masters with him. <img id="master" src="img/master.PNG"></p>
        <p>I play a tobias-inspired playstyle, mid lane preferred. This guide is not what I think is best, however. It will include several different playstyles and in-depth top lane discussion. I have played every type of gangplank you can think of - full ad runes, early game gangplank, jungle gangplank, ap gangplank, you name it. I've played it. In high elo NA. Which is why I think that this guide is actually worth reading. This guide is not law - you need to read through this guide, and play the many different variations. Gangplank is a champion that takes many games to learn - he is extremely rewarding, but expect to have a huge learning curve. Remember - practice makes perfect. Reading this guide isn't going to get you do diamond - reading this guide and finding your niche by playing a lot of gangplank will, however. </p>

        <h1>The most common question: Mid or Top?</h1>
        <p>Probably one of the most frequently asked questions, the answer is it really is up to you. For mid lane, you enjoy: 
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter lane - harder to overextend</li>
            <li>Your jungler is closer - you won't feel like an island if you have a support and jungler roaming near you.</li>
            <li>Easier to manage matchups - You can play very safe without getting froze on, guaranteeing farm and relevance in the game</li>
            <li>Team Comp - you generally run glass cannon in this build, so your team can still have a tank top lane and round out your team composition much better</li>
            <li>Have more control of the map - roaming is much easier in the mid lane</li>
        </ul>
        In the top lane, you can:
        <ul>
            <li>Use brush to use barrels</li>
            <li>Run AD and put pressure in top turret</li>
            <li>Build bruiser and 1v1/1v2</li>
            <li>Round out a team comp - maybe you have a tank support and utility mid, so your team needs more damage and aoe</li>
        </ul>
        I personally prefer the mid lane because top lane can have some nasty matchups that render you useless for the majority of the game, but that is because in high elo people will know to camp you very hard in the top lane, as gangplank is weak to tower dives. Tough mid lane matchups can be easier to work around if you understand wave management. For help on that, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/dEX7JxeKCxg">Dong Huap's video</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/HSQWcHIl5oc">SoloRenektonOnly's video</a>. I also run full glass cannon every game, making full damage gangplank top not as viable for every team composition. Many people have success in the top lane, however, it just requires much more lane macro play to prevent ganks.

        <section id="runes">
            <h1>Runes</h1>
            <p>(CDR= Cooldown Reduction)Runes are very important on gangplank. There are many variations, and they all are useful depending on your playstyle. CDR Runes are very popular and good because it decreases your huge barrel cooldown a ton, and helps you farm with q's much easier in the early game. You can read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gangplankmains/comments/5ews46/i_offered_to_compare_two_possible_gp_builds_and/">this</a> link for more reading.</p>
            <div id="adrunes"><h3>Attack Damage - RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS</h3>
                <p>Used more often in the top lane. Early game focused runes that will help you trade and push better. Take scaling health seals (yellows) against ap matchups, and alternatively change glyphs to magic resist or 6 flat CDR 3 scaling CDR 1 CDR quint if you want to give up 5% early CDR.<img src="img/adrunes.PNG"></p>
            </div>
            <div id="lethrunes"><h3>Lethality</h3>
                <p>Sacrifice early game stats altogether for a huge payout - run lethality runes. Lethality is a flat penetration stat that gets more and more effective as your enemies lvl increases. Therefore, early game you deal much, much less damage. It will make trading and last-hitting very difficult. However, come around triforce and level 7 and above and you will start seeing your lethality runes shine. This page will have the maximum damage in the late game.</p><img src="img/lethrunes.PNG">
                <p>SITUATIONAL: Swap out CDR for a lethality quint and magic resist glyphs (blues), useful for tough ap matchups that you still want to scale into, or swap out scaling health seals (yellows) for armor against tough ad matchups.</p>

        <section id="masteries">
            <h1>Masteries</h1>
            <p>The most common page for gangplank is 12-18-0, opting for bandit (a very effective mastery on gangplank - your Parrrley counts as a melee attack, giving you 10 gold every time you Q an enemy champion), Sorcery, and fresh blood. The other options are personal preference and playstyle. We will be discussing them.</p>

        <section id="combos">
            <h1>Combos</h1>
            <p>Note: All of these combos are useful. A good gangplank will use the right one at the right time, making gangplank one of the most advanced champions to play. I will discuss how to know when to use the right combo in the <a href="#mechanics">mechanics</a> section.
            <p><b>Double Barrel : </b>Bread and butter combo. Most useful combo, use it when chasing, kiting, etc. See: <a href="#doublebarrel">double barrel with auto</a>
