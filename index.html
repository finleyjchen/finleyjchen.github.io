		<p> My name is Finley Chen. I am a soon-to-be college freshman at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, studying political science.</p>
		<p>I'm trying out a lot of things right now, setting myself up to give me experience in the web development field as well as record my findings and learnings along the way, possibly for someone else who wants to step in my shoes. </p>
		<p>I am also going to develop a game, using an ASCII Art creating algorithm that I am trying to create in java. I know java from AP Computer Science and will be continuing to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, etc. I am also learning php scripts for my work in <a href="https://yourchristmasstore.com">magento</a>. 
		</p>
		Some goals that I would like to improve on: 
		<ul>
		<li>
		HTML - create good-looking websites and learn full HTML5 Semantics and use them effectively and efficiently.
		</li>
		<li>
		CSS - Learn SASS and other techniques and eventually create a custom Jekyll theme
		</li>
		<li>
		Javascript/Java
			<ul>
				<li>Make simple games on the fly</li>
				<li>
				Use javascript to create good looking websites with simple techniques such as dropdown windows, scrolling effects, hover effects, etc.</li>
				<li>
				Finish creating the ASCII Art generator and eventually incorporate it into a game (perhaps some sort of RPG?)</li>
				<li>
				Create a java applet or an android game</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
		PHP/MySQL - Learn how to create dynamic websites and databases to index and store data, and create scripts.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<p> Java Game Setup</p>
		<p> This game will use the ascii art generator I will eventually create. The game will contain a 2d array board that will contain ascii characters. These ascii characters are created and assigned as seperate objects that contain the locations of the ascii characters to be placed into the main array that will be displayed. Essentially the board is an array of ascii characters, which are determined by the drawings that will be converted to ascii characters.</p>
		<hr>
		I also play league of legends. I'm creating a center for gangplank mains to view easily new builds to try, new strategies and old ones to learn more about stuff. You can see the prototype <a href="gp/index.html">here</a>
