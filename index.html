		<p> Whoever sees this post, what do think about this website?</p>
		<p>I'm trying out a lot of things right now, setting myself up to give myself experience in the web development field as well as record my findings and learnings along the way, possibly for someone else who wants to step in my shoes. </p>
		<p>I am also going to develop a game, using an ASCII Art creating algorithm that I am trying to create in java. I know java from AP Computer Science and will be continuing to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, etc. I am also learning php scripts for my work in <a href="https://yourchristmasstore.com">magento</a>. 
		</p>
		Some goals that I would like to improve on: 
		<ul>
		<li>
		HTML - create good-looking websites and learn full HTML5 Semantics and use them effectively and efficiently.
		</li>
		<li>
		CSS - Learn SASS and other techniques and eventually create a custom Jekyll theme
		</li>
		<li>
		Javascript/Java
			<ul>
				<li>- Make simple games on the fly</li>
				<li>
				- use javascript to create good looking websites with simple techniques such as dropdown windows, scrolling effects, hover effects, etc.</li>
				<li>
				- Finish creating the ASCII Art generator and eventually incorporate it into a game (perhaps some sort of RPG?)</li>
				<li>
				- Create a java applet or an android game</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
		PHP/MySQL - Learn how to create dynamic websites and databases to index and store data, and create scripts.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		I also play league of legends. I'm creating a center for gangplank mains to view easily new builds to try, new strategies and old ones to learn more about stuff.
